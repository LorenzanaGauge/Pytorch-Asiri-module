This class allows the notebook to take a sequence of hyperparameters to prove in our training loop. The goal is to be performace-efficient, so we can 
take one tuple of parameters at once, without having problems with the memory.

        """
        In order to have a better control of our trainings, 
        we need to define a class, which enables us to
        calls some methods step-by-step along the main code
        for the training loop, so we can change some parameters
        or correct some mistakes or bugs if needed, without
        any complication.

        We first define the __init__ method, in which we will
        add as argument the number of batches per epoch, which
        will be useful when we display the progress bar
        during the trainig. We also initiate some variables
        that will help us to control the trainig parameters.
        We specify some fo them next:

        * run_count= We would make a code, in order that we
        can run multiple tuples of hyperparemeters at the same
        time, without initializing again manually each run. We
        will call a "run" to every training process involving
        a specific tuple of hyperparameters. Every run will be
        registered as a numeric variable.

        *run_start_time: We will take the
        total time our machine takes to do the full run process.

        * epoch_start_time: inside each run, we will have, as
        natural, epochs for the training process. We will
        measure the time it takes the network to process
        each epoch individually, aside from the run time.

        * epoch_data= foe each epoch, along all the batches,
        we will store the hyperparameters that
        defines each run. We will save this data in this
        variable.

        * epoch_results: The metrics obtained in each epoch
        will be saved here.

        * run_results: By the end of each run, we will store
        some dictionaries with the information for every
        run we can train in a specific execution of the 
        notebook.

        * progress. This will be the progress bar we will create
        for each batch. That is why we need the batches_per_epoch
        parameter. We will explain deeply later how to achieve 
        this.

        * batches_per_epoch: In order to create the progress bar,
        we need to tell the bar over which parameter we want
        to increase the bar over time. This will be the batches.
        Once a batch is finished by the network, we will increase
        by one the bar.
